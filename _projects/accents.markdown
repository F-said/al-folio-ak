This project explores how children use accent cues (native and foreign) to decide who to trust and who to learn from. Furthermore, she is interested in understating the intersection of accent and linguistic cues (e.g., certainty markers) and how they might be used to reduce accent-bias in early development.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.
