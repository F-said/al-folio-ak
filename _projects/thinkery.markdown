This project explores parent-child interactions in a local science museum in Texas, Austin. For the first time, additionally, to stationary cameras, we are also using eye-trackers on both the parent and the child, to get a closer estimate of what are they looking at and how the exhibits in the museum help their interactions and the childrenâ€™s learning. You can learn more about the Thinkery project here {https://thinkeryaustin.org/thinkery-connect/}
