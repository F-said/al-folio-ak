In this project, we explore how individuals in English-speaking and highly industrialized and westernized communities (US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand) evaluate different learning outcomes (imitation vs. innovation) in children. We also ask about parentsâ€™ expectations for their children and their future aspirations for them.
