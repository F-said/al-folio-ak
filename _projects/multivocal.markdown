In this project, we explore how individuals in English-speaking and highly industrialized and westernized communities (US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand) evaluate different learning outcomes (imitation vs. innovation) in children. We also ask about parents’ expectations for their children and their future aspirations for them.
