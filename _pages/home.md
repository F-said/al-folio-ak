Dr. Kertesz is a Developmental Psychologist with a focus on cognitive and social biases. She received her B.A. from Skidmore College and her M.A. and Ph.D. from The University of Texas at Austin. Her research is centered on how children and adults evaluate different sources of information using accent and language across cultures and languages. She is also interested in the role of social norms and normativity in adults' expectations of conformity. Dr. Kertesz is originally from Budapest, Hungary, but as a United World College Scholar she had the opportunity to appreciate global diversity from a young age, which then became her main mission in both her research and teaching of Psychological Science. In her free time she enjoys running and baking, the perfect combination of hobbies.
